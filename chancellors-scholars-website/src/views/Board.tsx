                        Hello everyone, my name is Maria Habashy. I am a Speculative
                        Design major and Urban Studies and Planning minor in Sixth
                        college. I joined the CSA Board because I was eager to learn and
                        have fun, values that align perfectly with the principles upheld
                        by the CSA. Currently, I serve as one of the Publicity Chairs,
                        where I get to channel my interest for design into crafting
                        engaging and effective promotional posts and materials for the CSA
                        Board. I thrive in taking ideas and feedback and turning it into
                        interactive content and materials for publicity. My role allows me
                        to merge creativity with practicality, and I am committed to
                        bringing our events, plans, and visions to life!
